Sabayon-Zorro-menu-lets
_______________________________________________________________________________________________
Simple {Zorro Security} Start menu separate from start menu (Systems default) ,for Quick accesses to tools in a pinch. 
User-Editable: To add tools as they come out.  And remove dead defunct tools too. 
Make it easy to make link-lets to user’s own Security scripts too. 
Once people have a full Sabayon distro installed the defector menus fill up, Mate or KDE etc/... show differing layouts. 
So a common security tools menu/s that are Desktop Agnostic would be the End Goal….

To alert of the really big hack; incoming now.... (loop play till //irritated) 

For ease of finding in a panic or organization it will duplicate to a point the default menu 
With Needed security tools IE a Fast menu...
As security Analyst "your Fencing with swords" , or the boss is” sticking you with it”... 
So not Fu!@#$ ing up when you can help it.

Not fumbling or being distracted by menu trash {{least in utter panic mode}} / differing Desktops IE KDE VS Gnome when in full blown Crisis or Crisis management mode 
You’re getting hacked time to take the sword given you by the good tools and fight, because 
if your network goes so could your very job. Even though it might be a Upstream F@#$ up from Microsoft 
, your boss will have expected you to probe the crap out of everything

In my case as a small biz owner, ITS ALL ME, if I fuck up it's not only my servers my pc's its my dollars, 
And My Office is based @ Home which will have 
The Mini-Bosses Gnashing their Teeth GF is a DBA/PhD Student and if Facebook or his MMO's games die.  
Die the stepson gets really NASTY, and often I work a IT Day job, so if they go though the VPN to my primary IT job….  Double FU@#$ed 

 For now I won’t be ""developing"" this, IE boot Pentoo (in a vm)  see the Pentoo...submenu ? Then Rip it out, 
Then, add it as a separate quick menu like but all linked to mainline sabayon Infrastructure.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1) Stick a quick menu Setup together, not too hard…. 

2) Make a package (thank mother#$% God there is an Ebuild IDE on Sf.net) target = the provision scripts /etc/skell.... or the like…. 
Which would clone it to User$ .files etc leaving the de-facto menus clean... of an extra submenu....

3) by making some virtual packages.... Quick an Ez for Any Installed Sabayon Environments to pull down my list of tools (some are yet in the Pentoo repo) so the few initial pressings will be a wee Bit FUGLY in making DVD’s  with Sabayon –(Zoro Project) Defender/ Templar Security Server. 

4) Making a menu with a sword Icon sounds "Cool" so if having a Brain fart.... in a crisis 
And panic mode users will be able to reach for the "Weapons” to fight the Evils assaulting their networks.... fight the good fight and be the “Zorro" network Hero...
