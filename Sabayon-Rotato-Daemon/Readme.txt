Ro-Ta a what ???

 Sabayon-Rotato-Daemon 
 Rotato is a "Spud" quality Shell Script Daemon... 

 call shell script for MATE/KDE/GNone/ETc to set Wallpaper...to spin every so often , change,change etc. 

One could set as a "Theme-paper too .... 

Sleep N, Sabayon-wp-a , b, c, d, e, etc. 

thier are scripts one could simply get set to cron.... 

basicly this scipt could be set to run @ X startup 


needs to do 

0) been doing Active Directy Admining and was on road alot , so my poor gentoo box //(Crickts chirp) sat unused for about 2 years
while I was dragged on traveling IT jobs... My Shell was "So" great to begin with (NEVER Niene no; hardly) 
it's more an Exersize to the weak pathetic shell-script muscels in my brain that have rusted. , 
I'm a sucky programmer , but as an Admin no matter how much you suck , you goto script at times... 
Going for Masters of Science in Information Security @ Wgu.edu and likely a MS-Certificate in Computer Forensics, and WGU requisites are , GIAC Certification , 
Certified Ethical Hacker , Certified Hacking Foresics Investigator, Cisco CCNA 

{{I have some Masters MBA/MS classes done elsewhare but Cancer/suden/death in family followed by a broken leg and crazy schedule tends to sometimes make you not so goood with the dean... }}

So as Much as I hate programing.... with my dyslexic ass , (I miss place code chuncks offten even on BS simple scripts at times cause of it it drives me bonkers) 
How Einstein managed with all that math ----and also presumably dislexic is a real mystery... 

Like it or not I HAVE to Sharpen my SH@#$% for code skills...as my MS/Certs will require me to shut up and Fu-ing code... 

Honeslty If I won the lotto and ran a software firm with my own devs.... the pobily cool Ideas I can come up with... vs what I personally can code .(inset hello world or slighly above hear....).... 


0-A) Hanging out with the local Py-devs..mmm free beer n Pizza and python Lessons ....{{http://www.meetup.com/python-182/}} eventually it would be nice to do this in Python insted of bash...
so that you could have say a Sabayon.xdtheme etc file to parse and a .conf file..

IE if Sabayon were to Ever Sell  Sabayon Enterpise Linux  (for Profit and large shares of the profits $$$$$ >>>>> Sabayon Linux Foundation)  Sabayon-Enterprise.xdtheme 
Brand,Branding and Brand with users till they are hypnotized with cool artwork and slogans. 

1) get a basic Dameon shell Script... /blow Dust off of Linux Mini admin Program guide //cough //cough...

(one in book) 


2) call Scripts... to do the wpaper/s...

3) get a prober routine Latter on... N$-Window-manger is runing.... n=??? Which , IE Kde,Mate,etc... 
then not run Scripts needlessly for other windowmangers, for now I'll just make simple versions for each....

4) hook it to windowmanagers on start. 


5) xsk some one for a simple gui tray icon to en/dis-able it , but for initial installs could brand up the users... 
IE 4th of JUly American flags etc.... etc. Patriotism , etc... 


6) Define a simple to parse conf-file. with arrays and pounds.... ie # {Sabayon-Branding-theme}/s  {Sabayon-Forensics-Theme} --The defalt forensics paper's cool 
but wolfden prolly got a few more Forensics'y papers..... 
and by that one could set them to change every few mins... 

by comenting out an item wala done wont show that set of Wpapers. 

{My-Theme}/s xdtheme $user-home/.xdthemes/mytheme 

simple scriptlet for the wpapers and all... 

7) start simple and add more features as time goes , anyone welcome to add changes...
